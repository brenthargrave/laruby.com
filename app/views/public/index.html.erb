				<strong>Boelter Hall</strong> building is adjacent to the engineering buildings and P. Lot 9.
				Sadly, parking is a pain in the ass, so unless you can find a spot on
				the street, the best places to park are lots #6, #8 and #9. Lot #6 is
				metered, though not cheap, and lots #9 and #8 will allow a daily pass for
				about $9. From #6 and #8, walk east a couple blocks to reach <strong>Boelter hall</strong>,
				then go to the <strong>4th floor</strong> to find us in <strong>room 4760</strong>. From #9, it's less
				than a block north.
				<br /><br />
				See you there!
